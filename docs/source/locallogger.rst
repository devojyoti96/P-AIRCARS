Local GUI Logger
================

1. To start and view local GUI logger, run:

   .. code-block :: bash
        
      run-mwa-mwalogger --jobid <jobid> 
        
2. If user forget P-AIRCARS <jobid>, but knows the log directory, run:

   .. code-block :: bash
    
       run-mwa-mwalogger --logdir <logdir> 
    
.. note ::

    Log directory is generally at `<workdir>/logs`. If ``prefect`` server is running, but still user wants to use local GUI logger, add ``--no-prefect`` with the above commands.

This will open the local GUI logger as shown below:
